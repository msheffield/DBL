# DBL

## Overview

This is an application that uses a firebase database to track train arrival times. Users can add a train via a form and have it stored in the database. The train tracker then will display the train times and calculate the next arrival time and how many minutes away. The progress bar shows how far the train is relative to it's frequency.
